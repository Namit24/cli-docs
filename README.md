This project cli-docs helps you generate markdown tailored for your project, dir structure and save workflow in graph format right from you terminal
I'm still working on the graph feature, feel free to contribute

The command:
1.) For dir structure: code-doc generate structure <project path>

2.) For md files: code-doc generate doc <project path>

3.) For graphs (Still on it): code-doc generate graphs <project path>

Feel free to contribute :)
